# Overview

### The purpose of this website

To display a clean and tidy website that can retain end-users to the point of contact to the company. The design of the website is aimed at the construction industry. I achieved this by using Html 5, CSS/SASS and javascript which ensures that the website is responsive on all devices.

# Features 

* Navbar to move between pages.

* Call to actions. With modal popup form vanilla JS.

* Contact form.

* Image gallery vanilla JS.

* Custom icons done in Photoshop.

* 5 responsive web pages.

### What could be added

Future updates could include a carousel for GIF file adverts.

Videos page for users to meet the people of the company.

News page of construction information.

# Technologies Utilized

* Html 5 
    
Was used for the main structure of the web design.

* CSS/SASS

Was used for the styling of the web design. SASS was used to compile the CSS file.

* CSS Flexbox & CSS Grid

Was used for the layout of the web design.

* Vanilla Javascript

Javascript Was used for image gallery and modals.

# Unit Testing

I have done extensive testing to make sure the links and buttons work to how they should do before production.

### What testing was done

* Manual testing :

    I went through the links to make sure they went to the correct pages.
    testing modals and image gallery.
    Used dev tools to ensure reponsiveness.

* Html Testing :

    Html was tested by opening up the code in different browsers to make sure worked. W3C mark up validation service was used to test the code.

* CSS Testing :

    CSS was tested by opening up the code in different browsers to make sure prefixs worked. W3C mark up validation service was used to test the code.

# Extra Notes

For future reference: This would be a personal project as I would be adding a couple of pages and features.

This is also directed to employers and universities to show that I am also learning new coding languages and best pratices.

After the completion of the Code Institute Diploma, I will be going for a BSC Degree in Software Development or Software Engineer.
